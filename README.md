# MyGame
A website with the purpose to offer a free game for entertainment.
As we can see from the title, "Pong" has a similarity to the reallife game of Ping-Pong.
The game is a classic. It is -to my knowledge- the first computergame to be a commercial success.
The gameplay:
Two ledgers moving up and down along the edges of the gamebox, attempting to hit the small bouncing ball. They imitate the rackets.
One racket is controlled by the player and the other is controlled by the computer. Player uses keys a and b to move up and down.
The goal is to get more points than the computer, before the game is over. 
My target audience are children, playful adults and people that enjoy retrogames.
