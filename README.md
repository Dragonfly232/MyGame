# MyGame
A website with the purpose to offer a free game for entertainment.
As we can see from the title, "Pong" has a similarity to the reallife game of Ping-Pong.
The game is a classic. It is -to my knowledge- the first computergame to be a commercial success.
My target audience are children, playful adults and people that enjoy retrogames.

# Features

 -Header:
I have chosen a modern, but retro flavoured design, with a colourful, but still pleasant colourtheme and a straightforward, minimal UI. The big headline "Play Pong" acts as a logo and 
tells the user what the site is about right away.

 -Gameplay:
 
Two paddles moving up and down along the edges of the gamebox, attempting to hit the small bouncing ball. They imitate the rackets.
One racket is controlled by the player and the other is controlled by the computer. Player uses arrowkeys up and down to move up and down.
The goal is to get more points than the computer, before the game is over. 
First player to hit a score of 10 wins.
