# MyGame
A website with the purpose to offer a free game for entertainment.
As we can see from the title, "Pong" has a similarity to the reallife game of Ping-Pong.
The game is a classic. It is -to my knowledge- the first computergame to be a commercial success.
My target audience are children, playful adults and people that enjoy retrogames.

# Features

 -Header:
I have chosen a modern, but retro flavoured design, with a colourful, pleasant theme and a straight-forward, minimal UI. The big headline "Play Pong" acts as a logo and 
tells the user what the site is about, right away.

 -Gameplay:
 
Two paddles moving up and down along the edges of the gamebox, attempting to hit the small bouncing ball.
Player 1 is controlled by keys "w" and "s" and Player 2 is controlled by keys "i" and "k".
The goal is to get more points than the other, before the game is over. 
First player to hit a score of 10 wins.
